✅ Before starting with backend development learning journey first learn this important JavaScript topics👇
- Fundamentals of JavaScript
- Arrays and Objects
- Array Methods(Mutation) - [ push|pop|toString|concat|unshift|shift|slice|splice ]
- Array Methods(Non-Mutation) - [ foreach | map | filter | reduce | find | indexOf --->[Most Imp👨‍💻] ]
- Functions return
- Async.js coding - [Callbacks, Async Functions, Async/Await]
-Fetch API



✅ Node.js👇
- Node.js Basics:
- Introduction to Node.js.
- Installing Node.js and npm - (Node Package Manager).
- Working with modules.
- File system operations.
- Understanding HTTP module.



✅ NPM👇
- NPM Understanding
- installing and uninstalling anything basics & advanced
- Understanding node_modules
- Dependencies
- devdependencies
- scripts ( understanding default scripts PATH and custom scripts )



✅ Express👇
- Express.js Framework
- Introduction to Express.js
- Setting up a basic Express application
- Routing
- Middleware
- Request and response handling
- Error handling



✅ Backend Series👇
Chp_01: Form Handling, Sessions & Cookies

Chp_02:
* Setting up parsers for form
* Setting up ejs for ejs pages
* Setting up public static files
* Dynamic Routing (dynamic routing || how to get data coming from frontend at backend route)

Chp_03: Making a notes taking web-app (Hands-on Practice till now what we learn)



✅ MongoDB👇
01_Practical_Learning:
* Data Storage
* Types of Data Base - SQL | NoSQL
* What and why?
* mongodb connection
* terminologies - collections, documents, schemas, keys, models
* CRUD operation - CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE

02_Practical_Learning:
* In this we create a web app with the help of EJS template engine for more implementing practical learning in CRUD operation also how mongodb is connecting to the backend

03_Authentication_Authorization
01_Theory👇
* Authentication - before sending data to the user first it check to the server who is user and it is present or not in the database
* Authorization - authorized to perform some tasks which are only allowed to be executed by the admin
---------------------------------------------------------------------
* How to set the cookies and read the cookie

*How to use bcrypt for password encryption and decryption (in decryption it basically compare the password in plain text and in hash if both the value is true then it means that the password is match otherwise it is false and it is not a matched password.)

*What is JWT and how to store the data in JWT also how to remove the data from JWT

02_Practical_Learning👇
* Create User Account
      - mongoose
      - schema
      - model
      - usercreate -> password -> hash
      - jwt token -> cookie

      - login -> token -> decrypt -> email


04_Data_Association
01_Theory👇
* referring the data between user and post by giving ObjectID

02_Practical_Learning👇
* Creating a web app where user can write there post
      - login and register
      - logout
      - post creation
      - post like
      - post edit
      - Multer
          ⬇️In Multer I learn the DiskStorage (in DiskStorage we can store our files in server) through which I made a upload profile picture section in which I can update the profile picture.
